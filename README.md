# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction
Real Estate Price Prediction using Machine Learning Algorithm
In this project, we had predicted the sale price of the houses using various machine learning algorithms.
Housing sales price are determined by numerous factors such as area of the property, location of the house, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms and so on.
Here, machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Lasso Regression technique and Decision Tree are used to build a predictive mode
